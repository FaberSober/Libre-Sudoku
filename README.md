# Libre-Sudoku
Sudoku app built with [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) and [Material3](https://m3.material.io/)

## Features
- Basic things such as pencil marks (notes), undo, game pauses and board reset
- 9x9 and 6x6 with 4 difficulties
- 2 input methods. Digit first and cell first
- 2 types of mistakes checking. First is detecting game rules violations and the second is checking with final solution
- Statistics and records. Best and average times, win streak, started/completed games count and win rate 
- Saves. You can continue any uncompleted game whenever you want
- Many settings and customizations such as auto erase notes, remaining uses, identical numbers highlight, app themes and more
- Tutorials for game techniques (in progress)
- Custom sudoku (manually or from string)

### Plans
- Better hint system (explain the next move instead of just reveal the number)
- 12x12 (need to implement zoom and pan on canvas because cells in 12x12 are too small)
- Full set of sudoku techniques tutorials
- Custom sudoku from gallery or camera
- More customizations (customize everything than can be customizedðŸ”¥)
- Something else
