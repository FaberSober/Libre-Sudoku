## App plans
- Better hint system (explain the next move instead of just reveal the number)
- Full set of sudoku techniques tutorials
- Custom sudoku from gallery or camera
- More customizations (customize everything that can be customizedðŸ”¥)
- Something else

### Project plans
- Improve project architecture. I'm still new to android and compose, so there are maybe some not so good approaches aches and I really want to fix them
